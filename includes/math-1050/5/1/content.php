								<p>Before we embark upon any further adventures with functions, we need to take some time to gather our thoughts and gain some perspective. Chapter 1 rst introduced us to functions in Section 1.3. At that time, functions were specic kinds of relations - sets of points in the plane which passed the Vertical Line Test, Theorem 1.1. In Section 1.4, we developed the idea that functions are processes - rules which match inputs to outputs - and this gave rise to the concepts of domain and range. We spoke about how functions could be combined in Section 1.5 using the four basic arithmetic operations, took a more detailed look at their graphs in Section 1.6 and studied how their graphs behaved under certain classes of transformations in Section 1.7. In Chapter 2, we took a closer look at three families of functions: linear functions (Section 2.1), absolute value functions1 (Section 2.2), and quadratic functions (Section 2.3). Linear and quadratic functions were special cases of polynomial functions, which we studied in generality in Chapter 3. Chapter 3 culminated with the Real Factorization Theorem, Theorem 3.16, which says that all polynomial functions with real coecients can be thought of as products of linear and quadratic functions. Our next step was to enlarge our eld2 of study to rational functions in Chapter 4. Being quotients of polynomials, we can ultimately view this family of functions as being built up of linear and quadratic functions as well. So in some sense, Chapters 2, 3, and 4 can be thought of as an exhaustive study of linear and quadratic3 functions and their arithmetic combinations as described in Section 1.5. We now wish to study other algebraic functions, such as f(x) = p x and g(x) = x2=3, and the purpose of the rst two sections of this chapter is to see how these kinds of functions arise from polynomial and rational functions. To that end, we rst study a new way to combine functions as dened below.</p>

If we take a step back and look at this from a procedural, `inputs and outputs' perspective, Dention 5.1 tells us the output from g  f is found by taking the output from f, f(x), and then making that the input to g. The result, g(f(x)), is the output from g  f. From this perspective, we see g  f as a two step process taking an input x and rst applying the procedure f then applying the procedure g.

								<p>It is important to note that every natural number is a whole number, which, in turn, is an integer. Each integer is a rational number (take \(b =1\) in the above deÔ¨Ånition for \(\mathbb Q\)) and the rational numbers are all real numbers, since they possess decimal representations.3 If we take \(b=0\) in the above deÔ¨Ånition of \(\mathbb C\), we see that every real number is a complex number. In this sense, the sets \(\mathbb N\), \(\mathbb W\), \(\mathbb Z\), \(\mathbb Q\), \(\mathbb R\), and \(\mathbb C\) are ‚Äònested‚Äô like Matryoshka dolls.</p>
								<p>For the most part, this textbook focuses on sets whose elements come from the real numbers \(\mathbb R\). Recall that we may visualize \(\mathbb R\) as a line. Segments of this line are called intervals of numbers. Below is a summary of the so-called interval notation associated with given sets of numbers. For intervals with Ô¨Ånite endpoints, we list the left endpoint, then the right endpoint. We use square brackets, ‚Äò\([\)‚Äô or ‚Äò\(]\)‚Äô, if the endpoint is included in the interval and use a Ô¨Ålled-in or ‚Äòclosed‚Äô dot to indicate membership in the interval. Otherwise, we use parentheses, ‚Äò\((\)‚Äô or ‚Äò\()\)‚Äô and an ‚Äòopen‚Äô circle to indicate that the endpoint is not part of the set. If the interval does not have Ô¨Ånite endpoints, we use the symbols \(-\infty\) to indicate that the interval extends indeÔ¨Ånitely to the left and \(\infty\) to indicate that the interval extends indeÔ¨Ånitely to the right. Since inÔ¨Ånity is a concept, and not a number, we always use parentheses when using these symbols in interval notation, and use an appropriate arrow to indicate that the interval extends indeÔ¨Ånitely in one (or both) directions.</p>

								<p>We will often have occasion to combine sets. There are two basic ways to combine sets: intersec-tion and union. We define both of these concepts below.</p>

								<p>Said differently, the intersection of two sets is the overlap of the two sets - the elements which the sets have in common. The union of two sets consists of the totality of the elements in each of the sets, collected together. For example, if \(A = \{ 1,2,3 \}\) and \(B = \{2,4,6 \}\), then \(A \cap B = \{2\}\) and \(A \cup B = \{1,2,3,4,6\}\). If \(A = [-5,3)\) and \(B = (1, \infty)\), then we can find \(A \cap B\) and \(A\cup B\) graphically. To find \(A\cap B\), we shade the overlap of the two and obtain \(A \cap B = (1,3)\). To find \(A \cup B\), we shade each of \(A\) and \(B\) and describe the resulting shaded region to find \(A \cup B = [-5,\infty)\).</p>
								<br>
								<p>While both intersection and union are important, we have more occasion to use union in this text than intersection, simply because most of the sets of real numbers we will be working with are either intervals or are unions of intervals, as the following example illustrates.</p>
